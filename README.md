# Hato Frontend

Hato is a digital platform designed to improve the management of hostels in Peru. It allows hostels to register guest check-ins and check-outs, manage room bookings, and provide room services without direct contact with the administrator.

## Features

- **Guest Management**: Register and manage guest check-ins and check-outs.
- **Room Booking**: Allow guests to book rooms online.
- **Service Requests**: Enable guests to request room services digitally.

## Cloning and Setting Up the Project

1. Clone the project from GitHub:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/luisdmaco/hato.git
    ```
    Navigate into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd hato
    ```

2. Install the required libraries and dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
